# Thought Book ✍️  
_A fast, offline-first, and private space for your thoughts._  

---

## 🌍 Why Thought Book?  
Most note apps are slow, online-dependent, or cluttered. I needed a way to capture ideas instantly, without worrying about internet or privacy. Thought Book was built for exactly that:  

- 📝 Capture a thought the moment it comes.  
- 🚫 No internet required.  
- 🔒 Local and secure by default.

## 💡 Key Features  
- **Instant launch** with a global shortcut.  
- **Offline-only** by design — works anywhere.  
- **Local encryption** to keep your notes private.  
- **Optional backup** (lightly encrypted) to Google Drive.
