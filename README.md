# Thought Book ✍️  
_A dedicated, offline, and private space for your thoughts._  

---

## 🌍 Why I Built It  
I often wanted to capture a thought quickly, but:  
- No pen around.  
- Google Notes didn’t work offline.  
- Notepad left private notes exposed.  

---

## 💡 The Solution  
- Opens instantly with a shortcut.  
- Works fully offline.  
- Encrypts notes for privacy.  
- Backups to Google Drive (lightly encrypted).
