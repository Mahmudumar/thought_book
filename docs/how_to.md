## Notes
* **All notes' content are encrypted in the database using a simple caesar cipher**

* The backup process requires internet connection and the `Thought Book` folder is less than 1MB depending on what's inside. If you want to backup only the `BMTbnotes.db` you can backup only that instead of the entire folder.
